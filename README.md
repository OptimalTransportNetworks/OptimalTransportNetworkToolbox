**Optimal Transport Networks in Spatial Equilibrium - MATLAB Toolbox v1.0.4b**

MATLAB OptimalTransportNetworkToolbox (v1.0.4b) implementing the quantitative spatial economic model of:

Fajgelbaum, P. D., & Schaal, E. (2020). Optimal transport networks in spatial equilibrium. *Econometrica, 88*(4), 1411-1452.

The model/software uses duality principles to optimize over the space of networks, nesting an optimal flows problem and a neoclasical general-equilibrium trade model into a global network design problem to derive the optimal (welfare maximizing) transport network (extension) from any primitive set of economic fundamantals [population per location, productivity per location for each of *N* traded goods, endowment of a non-traded good, and (optionally) a pre-existing transport network]. For more information about the model see [this folder](https://github.com/SebKrantz/OptimalTransportNetworkToolbox/tree/main/docs/paper_materials).

The model is the first of its kind and a pathbreaking contribution towards the welfare maximizing planning of transport infrastructure. Its creation has been funded by the European Union through an [ERC Research Grant](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/804095). Community efforts to further improve the code are welcome.
